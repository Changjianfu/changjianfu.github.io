<p>Welcome!<br><br>I am a &lt;Professor&gt; at &lt;Sichuan University&gt;. You may reach at me by emails.
I am interested in interplay between Representation Theory of finite dimensional Algebras and related topics, such as quantum groups, cluster algebras and combinatorics. My research is currently supported by NSFC.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my (pre)publications under the <a href="http://changjianfu.github.io/homepage/research/">RESEARCH</a> tab, and a list of teaching and seminars under the <a href="http://changjianfu.github.io/homepage/teaching/">TEACHING</a> tab. 
  You may also interested in  my selected talks at <a href="http://changjianfu.github.io/homepage/talk/">TALKS</a> tab. <br><br>
